# Me
  I have very little experience gardening and growing anything other than houseplants. This project was born out of the desire to create a simple grow journal documenting my journey. Its more for me than it is for you.  
  
 **IMPORTANT** These plants are being grown legally in the great state of Illinois under their [Medical Cannabis Program](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/medical-cannabis)
