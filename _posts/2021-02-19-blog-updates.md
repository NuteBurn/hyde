## Airtable
I'm going to try my damnedest to keep as much data from my grows as possible and keep it open on this blog. I chose [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) because its simple enough to integrate with Jekyll and Github pages through an iframe.

It's pretty bare bones right now as I don't have much data to input yet, but it will <i class="green">grow</i> with my plants.

## Site Tweaks

Made some changes to the blog, hope it's looking crispy.

## The Other Equipment

Amazon has the rest of the equipment queued for delivery this weekend. I'll be running to the local hydro store to pick up some soil and nutrients as well. Good opportunity to talk shop with someone who knows something about indoor gardening.
