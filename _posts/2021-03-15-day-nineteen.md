## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

Went to Home Depot on Friday and picked up some [Captain Jack's Deadbug](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Bonide-32-oz-Captain-Jack-s-Deadbug-Brew-Ready-To-Use-2506/203564356) insect spray. Folks online suggested it for controlling bugs in an organic grow, and any product with a dude in a Hawaiian shirt on the label is okay by me. I gave the girls a light coating and spayed a little on the top soil as well, then let it sit for a few minutes and went in with a tissue to wipe up any large droplets so it wouldn't burn the leaves. Apparently you're supposed to apply right before a dark cycle so you don't risk burning the leaves, so I'll do that next time rather than in the middle of the light cycle.  

I finally watered in the Mosquito bits too so im hoping that will kill off any larva still in the soil.  

I also hung some yellow sticky traps in the tent to help me catch and monitor the ghats and other pests.
Since applying I haven't noticed any more bug damage so thats encouraging, but have spotted a gnat on a trap and one or two flying around in the tent. Next time I'll do a soil drench with the Captain Jacks to really take those fuckers out.

## Blumats

I watered the girls first thing in the morning Saturday, around 9:30, and waited about 12 hours to install the Blumats. The idea is that you install them at your desired moisture level and it will keep the pots in that range. I do think they may need some fine tunning as I filled the reservoir with 7 liters of water and as of Monday afternoon its still at about the same level (36 hours). I have a week and a half to figure this out before I leave for a few days...

## Light Schedule

I updated the light cycle to 20 on and 4 off on Saturday. I figure with a reliable water source they can take the extra 2 hours of light and im hoping they show me their appreciation with more growth.
