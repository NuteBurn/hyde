## Grow Tent Complete
The rest of the grow tent supplies came yesterday and I spent the afternoon putting it all together. I'm very happy with my selections. The AC Infinity Fan is a bit more complex than I thought and it will likely take a little bit of time to get it dialed in for best performance.

Catnip and basil acting as placeholder until I get the bag filled and seeds planted tomorrow.

## Soil Update
Stopped by the local hydro store today. Shout out to [Brew & Grow Chicago](https://www.brewandgrow.com/). I picked up [Detroit Nutrient Company's Just Add Water](https://detroitnutrientcompany.com/collections/most-popular/products/great-lakes-water-only-soil) mix and {% site.data.media[FFHF].mdlink %}.

I'm going to start the seeds in a small amount of Happy Frog surrounded by the DNC. The idea is that the Happy Frog is mild enough to prevent <i class="orange">nuteburn</i> and let it grow into the hotter DNC soil.
