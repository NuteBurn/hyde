## 10PM Update

Seeds have sprouted, and I've removed the lid. I stand by my initial assessment though, I do think I planted them too deep.  
The soil felt like it could use a little water so I use gave them both 1.5oz of the same pHed water. I tested it again, it was at 6.2. Not sure if I should have used fresher water but it seemed like a waste.


## I Planted Too Deep

Day 3 and they still haven't sprouted. I'm almost certain its because I planted them too deep. It should have been closer to 1/2 Inch deep rather than 1 inch, <i class="orange">lesson learned.</i>

I do suspect they will break ground either later today or tomorrow. 🤞🤞

## Misting

Over the past 3 days I've been monitoring the soil and lids and misting both with filtered tap water when they were dry.

## Dreaming Of Red

These gals haven't sprouted yet and I'm already dreaming about the next run. I'm <i class="purple">leaning heavily</i> towards [Sweet Seeds Red Family.](https://sweetseeds.es/en/tag/red-family/) 23 Year old would have wanted this. 🍁
