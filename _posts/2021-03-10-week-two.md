## Day Fourteen

Well I haven't killed them yet and its been two weeks! I'm excited to see what these gals do this 3rd week.

### Fucking Gnats

Growing in soil is the supposed to be <i class="organe">laid back</i> but you need to be on top of the bugs. They love the same dirt my girls do. Last night I sprinkled some [Mosquito Bites](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Mosquito-Bits-30-oz-Granular-Biological-Mosquito-Control-117-6/206940251) on the top soil because I had it for the house plants, and [Sticks Be Growing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBzMP_v1kCCqLJiyJBdLyXw) on YouTube uses it in his setup for controlling gnats. You need to water after applying so the bacteria inoculates the soil but they don't need the water yet. It's currently just there letting the gnats know their days are numbered.

I just ordered some yellow traps too so I can get a handle on this before it gets out of control.

### Blumats

They should be showing up tomorrow, right on time for a fresh watering so I can have them in as soon as Friday. You need to water right before you put them in the ground, so I'll have more details when I have it set up.
