## Babies

I might have watered the girls too much yesterday as they were still plenty wet this morning and well into the evening.

The AK is growing a bit faster than the Pineapple, but I guess that's to be expected from a company called 420FastBuds. See for yourself.

## Setup Tweak and More Equipment

I took some of the extra ducting I had and fashioned up a little hood to vent the humidifier directly into the tent yesterday. It's helped keep the RH at around 50-55%. It was just on the side of the tent but that wasn't doing much, RH was 40-45%, and unfortunately its too big to keep in the tent. You use what you have.

Just ordered a small little Tetra 10 gallon air pump with some tubing for teas and dechlorination from Chewy. I just need an air stone and it will look <i class="orange">almost</i> like I know what I'm doing.
